Usage
=====

After installing the extension with EM, go to XCarousel.WebHome

Here click the ADD NEW ENTRY from the Actions section on the right, and give a name to your new carousel.
You will then be prompted to the carousel's edit mode, where you can set it up as you like.
By default the auto-sliding optin will be enabled, and 3 empty slides will be created automatically.
Create or delete as many slides as you want using "Add new slide/Delete Slide" buttons, and set an image for each of your slides.

* Adding an image for each slide is the only mandatory thing to do for the carousel to function.

After the setup is done, you can insert the new carousel into any page using the display macro.

ex: `{{display reference="XCarousel.Demo" type="document"/}}`
